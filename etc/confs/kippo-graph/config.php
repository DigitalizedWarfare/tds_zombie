# Which geolocation method should be used -- Default: LOCAL (MaxMind)

# The following value determines whether Kippo-Graph will
# automatically check if a newer version is available for download.
# You can inspect the function at kippo-graph/include/misc/versionCheck.php.
# It works by comparing the latest version number that resides
# in a text file uploaded on Kippo-Graph's website against the
# 'VERSION' definition inside versionCheck.php. While in theory you can
# trust the remote website, I realise that you might think that this check
# poses a risk to the privacy of your honeypot's IP address.
# For this reason, the following value ensures that having the
# update checking feature enabled is your choice and not forced.
# Change NO to YES if you want to enable it.

# The following value determines the minimum size (in kb) of the Kippo log needed to be
# shown in Kippo-Playlog. Any value below it will be ignored.
# This is useful to remove any sessions that just join and quit immediately afterwards.
# The value may need tweaking based on the length of the MOTD (displayed after a successful login).
